## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -D playwright-coverage-reporter
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze coverage in your Playwright tests
npx playwright-coverage analyze

# Generate reports in all formats
npx playwright-coverage analyze --format all --output ./coverage-report

# Run a demo to see how it works
npx playwright-coverage demo
```

### Integration with Playwright

1. **Initialize configuration**:
```bash
npx playwright-coverage init
```

2. **Create a coverage fixture**:
```bash
npx playwright-coverage fixture -o src/test/coverage-fixture.ts
```

3. **Use in your tests**:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from './coverage-fixture';

test('login flow with coverage', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'user@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="welcome"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## üìñ Usage

### CLI Commands

#### `analyze`
Analyze test coverage for Playwright tests.

```bash
npx playwright-coverage analyze [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --config <path>` - Path to configuration file
- `-i, --include <patterns...>` - Include file patterns (default: `["**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.test.ts"]`)
- `-e, --exclude <patterns...>` - Exclude file patterns
- `-o, --output <path>` - Output directory (default: `./coverage-report`)
- `-f, --format <format>` - Report format: `console|json|html|lcov|istanbul|all`
- `-t, --threshold <percentage>` - Coverage threshold (default: 80)
- `-v, --verbose` - Verbose output
- `--page-url <urls...>` - Page URLs to analyze

#### `mismatch`
Analyze selector mismatches between tests and page elements.

```bash
npx playwright-coverage mismatch [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-c, --config <path>` - Path to configuration file
- `-i, --include <patterns...>` - Include file patterns (default: `["**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.test.ts"]`)
- `-e, --exclude <patterns...>` - Exclude file patterns
- `-v, --verbose` - Verbose output
- `--page-url <urls...>` - Page URLs to analyze

The `mismatch` command helps identify why your test selectors aren't matching actual page elements, providing specific recommendations for improving test coverage.

#### `demo`
Run a demonstration of the coverage tool.

```bash
npx playwright-coverage demo [options]
```

#### `init`
Initialize a configuration file.

```bash
npx playwright-coverage init [--force]
```

#### `fixture`
Generate test fixture code.

```bash
npx playwright-coverage fixture [-o <output>]
```

### Configuration

Create a `playwright-coverage.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Test files to include
  include: ['**/*.spec.ts', '**/*.test.ts', '**/*.e2e.ts'],

  // Files and directories to exclude
  exclude: ['node_modules/**', 'dist/**', '**/coverage/**'],

  // Elements to ignore during discovery
  ignoreElements: [
    '[data-testid="skip-coverage"]',
    '.test-only',
    '[aria-hidden="true"]'
  ],

  // Page URLs to analyze for element discovery
  pageUrls: [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://localhost:3000/login',
    'http://localhost:3000/admin'
  ],

  // Coverage threshold percentage
  coverageThreshold: 80,

  // Output directory for reports
  outputPath: './coverage-report',

  // Report format(s)
  reportFormat: 'all',

  // Enable element discovery
  discoverElements: true,

  // Enable static code analysis
  staticAnalysis: true,

  // Enable runtime tracking during tests
  runtimeTracking: false
};
```

## üìä Reports

### Coverage Report
```
üîç Starting Playwright coverage analysis...
üìä Coverage Summary:
   Total Elements: 24
   Covered Elements: 18
   Coverage: 75% ‚ö†Ô∏è

üìÑ Coverage by Type:
   Buttons: 8/10 (80%)
   Inputs: 6/8 (75%)
   Links: 4/6 (67%)

üéØ Uncovered Elements:
   ‚Ä¢ button: "Submit Order" (demo-page:checkout.spec.ts:15)
   ‚Ä¢ input: "Search" (demo-page:search.spec.ts:8)
```

### Selector Mismatch Analysis
```
üîç Analyzing selector mismatches...
üìä Selector Mismatch Analysis:
Total selectors in tests: 699
Selectors that match elements: 15
Selectors with no matches: 684

‚ùå Common Mismatch Issues:
  css: 450 failing selectors
  text: 120 failing selectors
  test-id: 114 failing selectors

üîç Sample Mismatches:
  ‚Ä¢ button[type="submit"] (css)
    Reason: CSS selector 'button[type="submit"]' matches no elements
  ‚Ä¢ :text("Sign In") (text)
    Reason: Text selector 'Sign In' not found. Current page text: Login, Register

üí° Recommendations:
  ‚Ä¢ Add data-testid attributes to interactive elements for more reliable testing
  ‚Ä¢ 114 test ID selectors are failing - verify test IDs match actual elements
  ‚Ä¢ Consider using test IDs instead of text selectors for better stability
```

### HTML Report
Generate an interactive HTML report with detailed element information and coverage breakdowns.

### Istanbul/LCOV Reports
Export coverage data in standard Istanbul formats for CI/CD integration with tools like Codecov, Coveralls, or GitHub's coverage visualization.

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Element Discovery

Configure element discovery for your specific application:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ignoreElements: [
    '[data-testid="skip-coverage"]',
    '.test-only',
    '[aria-hidden="true"]',
    '.development-only'
  ],
  discoverElements: true
};
```

### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Coverage Analysis
  run: npx playwright-coverage analyze --format istanbul --output coverage

- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage/lcov.info
```

#### Multiple Page Analysis
```bash
npx playwright-coverage analyze --page-url "https://example.com" --page-url "https://app.example.com"
```

### Runtime Tracking

For more accurate coverage, enable runtime tracking:

```javascript
// In your test configuration
module.exports = {
  runtimeTracking: true,
  // This will track actual interactions during test execution
};
```

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Static Analysis**: Scans your test files to extract all selectors used in Playwright test commands
2. **Element Discovery**: Launches a browser to discover all interactive elements on specified pages
3. **Coverage Calculation**: Matches discovered elements against test selectors to determine coverage
4. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive reports in multiple formats

## üìã Examples

### Basic E2E Test Coverage

```typescript
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('user registration flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/register');

  // These interactions will be tracked for coverage
  await page.fill('[data-testid="username"]', 'john_doe');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'john@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'securepassword');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Coverage Analysis Result

After running the coverage analysis, you'll get a detailed report showing:
- Which elements are covered by tests
- Which interactive elements are missing test coverage
- Coverage percentages by element type
- Recommendations for improving coverage

## üîÑ Version Management

This project uses **lefthook** and **package-bump** for automatic version management:

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Linting**: Automatically lints code before commits
- **Build & Test**: Ensures code builds and tests pass before committing
- **Version Bump**: Automatically bumps patch version when source files change
- **Staging**: Automatically stages the bumped `package.json` for commit

### Manual Version Bumps
```bash
npm run release        # Patch version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
npm run release:minor  # Minor version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
npm run release:major  # Major version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
```

### Publishing Workflow
1. Make changes to source files
2. Git commit triggers automatic version bump (pre-commit hook)
3. Push to main branch triggers npm publish (GitHub Actions)
4. GitHub release is created automatically
