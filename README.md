> üìä **v2.0.26** - Native Playwright integration for UI element coverage analysis. Discover interactive elements during test execution and generate comprehensive coverage reports.

Playwright Coverage Reporter helps you ensure your E2E tests are thoroughly testing all interactive elements on your web pages. It integrates directly with Playwright's test runner to analyze coverage during actual test execution.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç **Runtime Element Discovery**: Automatically discover interactive elements during test execution
- üìà **Coverage Analysis**: Analyze test files to determine which elements are covered by selectors
- üìä **Multiple Reports**: Generate console, JSON, HTML, and LCOV coverage reports
- üéØ **Istanbul Integration**: Export coverage data in LCOV format for CI/CD integration
- ‚ö° **Easy Setup**: Simple Playwright config integration - no separate configuration files needed
- üèóÔ∏è **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- üéõÔ∏è **Flexible Configuration**: Extensive configuration options for different project needs
- üöÄ **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with existing Playwright configs

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -D playwright-coverage-reporter
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Add to your existing `playwright.config.ts`**:
```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import { PlaywrightCoverageReporter } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  // ... your existing configuration
  reporter: [
    ['html'],  // Keep your existing reporters
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, {
      outputPath: './coverage-report',
      threshold: 80,
      verbose: true
    }]
  ],
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

2. **Run your tests**:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

3. **View the coverage report**:
```bash
# Console output appears automatically during test execution
# For HTML report: open coverage-report/index.html
```

That's it! No separate configuration files needed - everything is configured directly in your Playwright config.

### Automatic Setup (Optional)

If you prefer automatic setup, you can use the CLI:

```bash
npx playwright-coverage setup-reporter --type development
```

## üîß Configuration

### Configuration Options

All configuration is done directly in your `playwright.config.ts` reporter section:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `outputPath` | string | `./coverage-report` | Directory for coverage reports |
| `format` | string | `console` | Report format: `console`, `html`, `json`, `lcov`, `all` |
| `threshold` | number | `80` | Coverage threshold percentage (0-100) |
| `verbose` | boolean | `false` | Enable detailed logging |
| `elementDiscovery` | boolean | `true` | Auto-discover elements on page load |
| `runtimeDiscovery` | boolean | `false` | Track interactions during tests |
| `pageUrls` | string[] | `[]` | Specific pages to analyze |
| `captureScreenshots` | boolean | `false` | Enable screenshots for debugging |

### Configuration Presets

Choose from pre-configured setups:

```typescript
// Development setup with detailed HTML reports
import { CoveragePresets } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.development()]
  ]
});

// CI/CD setup with JSON reports
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.ci()]
  ]
});

// Comprehensive setup with all features
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.comprehensive()]
  ]
});
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure options via environment variables:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_COVERAGE_OUTPUT=./custom-coverage
PLAYWRIGHT_COVERAGE_FORMAT=html
PLAYWRIGHT_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=90
PLAYWRIGHT_COVERAGE_VERBOSE=true

### HTML Report

Generate an interactive HTML report with detailed element information and coverage breakdowns.

### LCOV Reports

Export coverage data in standard LCOV format for CI/CD integration with tools like Codecov, Coveralls, or GitHub's coverage visualization.

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Fixtures

For maximum control, you can use the custom fixtures approach:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter/fixtures';

test('user flow with coverage tracking', async ({ page, trackInteraction }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');

  // Track interactions automatically
  await trackInteraction('#email', 'fill');
  await page.fill('#email', 'user@example.com');

  await trackInteraction('button[type="submit"]', 'click');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="dashboard"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run Tests with Coverage
  run: npx playwright test

- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage-report/lcov.info
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Low Coverage Percentage
**Issue**: Getting 0% or very low coverage despite having tests
**Solution**:
- Ensure `elementDiscovery: true` is set in your configuration
- Check that tests are actually interacting with elements
- Verify selectors in tests match actual page elements

#### Coverage Reports Not Generated
**Issue**: No coverage reports are created after running tests
**Solution**:
- Ensure PlaywrightCoverageReporter is properly configured in your playwright.config.ts
- Check that tests are passing (failed tests are excluded from coverage)
- Verify the output directory permissions

#### TypeScript Configuration Issues
**Issue**: TypeScript errors when importing the reporter
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're using TypeScript files (`.ts`)
- Check that the package is properly installed: `npm install -D playwright-coverage-reporter`
- Make sure your tsconfig.json includes the node_modules type resolution
