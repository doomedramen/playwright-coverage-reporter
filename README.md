## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -D playwright-coverage-reporter
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze coverage in your Playwright tests
npx playwright-coverage analyze

# Generate reports in all formats
npx playwright-coverage analyze --format all --output ./coverage-report

# Run a demo to see how it works
npx playwright-coverage demo
```

### Integration with Playwright

#### üéØ **NEW: Native Playwright Reporter Integration**

The recommended approach is to use the **native Playwright reporter** for seamless integration with your existing test suite.

##### Quick Setup

1. **Set up the reporter**:
```bash
npx playwright-coverage setup-reporter --type development
```

2. **Run your tests**:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

3. **View the coverage report**:
```bash
# Console output appears automatically during test execution
# For HTML report: open coverage-report/index.html
```

##### Manual Configuration

Add the coverage reporter to your `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import { PlaywrightCoverageReporter } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['html'],
    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results.json' }],
    [
      PlaywrightCoverageReporter,
      {
        outputPath: './coverage-report',
        format: 'console',
        threshold: 80,
        verbose: true,
        elementDiscovery: true,
        pageUrls: ['http://localhost:3000'],
        runtimeDiscovery: true
      }
    ]
  ],

  // Rest of your Playwright config...
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

##### Configuration Presets

Choose from pre-configured setups:

```typescript
// Development setup with detailed HTML reports
import { CoveragePresets } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.development()]
  ]
});

// CI/CD setup with JSON reports
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.ci()]
  ]
});

// Comprehensive setup with all features
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.comprehensive()]
  ]
});
```

##### Reporter Features

- **üîÑ Runtime Discovery**: Discover elements during actual test execution
- **üìä Real-time Analysis**: Coverage calculated from actual test interactions
- **üéØ Test-aware Tracking**: Analyzes test steps and execution context
- **üì± Multi-browser Support**: Works across all Playwright browsers
- **üöÄ Zero Setup**: Works out of the box with existing Playwright configs

#### Legacy Standalone Approach

1. **Initialize configuration**:
```bash
npx playwright-coverage init
```

2. **Create a coverage fixture**:
```bash
npx playwright-coverage fixture -o src/test/coverage-fixture.ts
```

3. **Use in your tests**:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from './coverage-fixture';

test('login flow with coverage', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'user@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="welcome"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Configuration

Create a `playwright-coverage.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Test files to include
  include: ['**/*.spec.ts', '**/*.test.ts', '**/*.e2e.ts'],

  // Files and directories to exclude
  exclude: ['node_modules/**', 'dist/**', '**/coverage/**'],

  // Elements to ignore during discovery
  ignoreElements: [
    '[data-testid="skip-coverage"]',
    '.test-only',
    '[aria-hidden="true"]'
  ],

  // Page URLs to analyze for element discovery
  pageUrls: [
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://localhost:3000/login',
    'http://localhost:3000/admin'
  ],

  // Automatically start dev server from Playwright config
  webServer: true,

  // Path to Playwright config file (optional)
  playwrightConfigPath: 'playwright.config.js',

  // Coverage threshold percentage
  coverageThreshold: 80,

  // Output directory for reports
  outputPath: './coverage-report',

  // Report format(s)
  reportFormat: 'all',

  // Enable element discovery
  discoverElements: true,

  // Enable static code analysis
  staticAnalysis: true,

  // Enable runtime tracking during tests
  runtimeTracking: false
};
```

## üöÄ Web Server Integration

The tool can automatically start your development server before running coverage analysis, eliminating the need to manually start servers.

### Automatic Dev Server

**üöÄ Zero Configuration (Recommended):**
```bash
# Automatically starts dev server if found in Playwright config
npx playwright-coverage analyze

# Use custom Playwright config path
npx playwright-coverage analyze --playwright-config configs/playwright.dev.js

# Explicitly disable auto-start (if server is already running)
npx playwright-coverage analyze --no-web-server
```

**Manual Control:**
```bash
# Force start dev server even if not in Playwright config
npx playwright-coverage analyze --web-server

# Explicitly disable automatic server startup
npx playwright-coverage analyze --no-web-server
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Custom Playwright config path (optional)
  playwrightConfigPath: 'playwright.config.js',

  // Rest of configuration...
  pageUrls: ['http://localhost:3000']
};
```

### How It Works

1. **Auto-Detects Playwright Config**: Automatically reads your `playwright.config.js` file
2. **Extracts Patterns**: Pulls test directories, patterns, and server configuration
3. **Starts Server Automatically**: If `webServer` is configured, launches it using the same command Playwright uses
4. **Waits for Ready**: Checks that the server is responding before proceeding
5. **Runs Analysis**: Performs coverage analysis on the running server
6. **Cleanup**: Automatically stops the server when analysis completes

> üí° **Smart Behavior**: The tool automatically enables dev server startup when it finds `webServer` configuration in your Playwright config. Use `--no-web-server` to disable this behavior.

### Playwright Web Server Configuration

Configure your `playwright.config.js` with a web server:

```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120 * 1000
  },

  // Rest of Playwright config...
};
```

### Manual Web Server Configuration

If you prefer not to use Playwright's web server config, you can configure it directly:

```javascript
// playwright-coverage.config.js
module.exports = {
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:5173',
    port: 5173,
    reuseExistingServer: true,
    timeout: 30000,
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'development'
    }
  }
};
```

## üìä Reports

### Coverage Report
```
üîç Starting Playwright coverage analysis...
üìä Coverage Summary:
   Total Elements: 24
   Covered Elements: 18
   Coverage: 75% ‚ö†Ô∏è

üìÑ Coverage by Type:
   Buttons: 8/10 (80%)
   Inputs: 6/8 (75%)
   Links: 4/6 (67%)

üéØ Uncovered Elements:
   ‚Ä¢ button: "Submit Order" (demo-page:checkout.spec.ts:15)
   ‚Ä¢ input: "Search" (demo-page:search.spec.ts:8)
```

### Selector Mismatch Analysis
```
üîç Analyzing selector mismatches...
üìä Selector Mismatch Analysis:
Total selectors in tests: 699
Selectors that match elements: 15
Selectors with no matches: 684

‚ùå Common Mismatch Issues:
  css: 450 failing selectors
  text: 120 failing selectors
  test-id: 114 failing selectors

üîç Sample Mismatches:
  ‚Ä¢ button[type="submit"] (css)
    Reason: CSS selector 'button[type="submit"]' matches no elements
  ‚Ä¢ :text("Sign In") (text)
    Reason: Text selector 'Sign In' not found. Current page text: Login, Register

üí° Recommendations:
  ‚Ä¢ Add data-testid attributes to interactive elements for more reliable testing
  ‚Ä¢ 114 test ID selectors are failing - verify test IDs match actual elements
  ‚Ä¢ Consider using test IDs instead of text selectors for better stability
```

### HTML Report
Generate an interactive HTML report with detailed element information and coverage breakdowns.

### Istanbul/LCOV Reports
Export coverage data in standard Istanbul formats for CI/CD integration with tools like Codecov, Coveralls, or GitHub's coverage visualization.

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Element Discovery

Configure element discovery for your specific application:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ignoreElements: [
    '[data-testid="skip-coverage"]',
    '.test-only',
    '[aria-hidden="true"]',
    '.development-only'
  ],
  discoverElements: true
};
```

### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Coverage Analysis
  run: npx playwright-coverage analyze --format istanbul --output coverage

- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage/lcov.info
```

#### Multiple Page Analysis
```bash
npx playwright-coverage analyze --page-url "https://example.com" --page-url "https://app.example.com"
```

### Runtime Tracking

For more accurate coverage, enable runtime tracking:

```javascript
// In your test configuration
module.exports = {
  runtimeTracking: true,
  // This will track actual interactions during test execution
};
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### TypeScript Configuration Warnings
**Issue**: Warning about TypeScript config not loading
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot load TypeScript config playwright.config.ts. This requires either ts-node or a compiled JS version.
```
**Solution**: This is just a warning - the tool continues to work correctly. No action needed.

#### Low Coverage Percentage
**Issue**: Getting 0% or very low coverage despite having tests
**Solution**:
- Ensure your test files are being included (`--include patterns`)
- Check that page URLs are accessible and load correctly
- Verify selectors in tests match actual page elements

#### Browser Launch Issues
**Issue**: Browser fails to launch or pages don't load
**Solution**:
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install`
- Check if your application server is running
- Verify page URLs are correct and accessible

#### Coverage Mismatch
**Issue**: Coverage doesn't match expectations
**Solution**:
- Use the `mismatch` command to analyze selector issues
- Check if elements have proper accessible attributes
- Verify test selectors are targeting correct elements

#### File Path Issues
**Issue**: CLI can't find test files or configuration
**Solution**:
- Use absolute paths or run from the correct directory
- Check file permissions and ensure files exist
- Verify include/exclude patterns match your file structure

### Performance Tips

- **Use specific include patterns**: Avoid analyzing unnecessary files
- **Limit page URLs**: Only analyze pages you actually test
- **Disable runtime discovery**: If not needed, set `runtimeDiscovery: false`
- **Use CI preset**: For automated pipelines, use the CI configuration preset

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From Standalone CLI to Playwright Reporter

If you're currently using the standalone CLI, here's how to migrate:

#### Automatic Migration

```bash
# Automatically migrate your existing configuration
npx playwright-coverage migrate-to-reporter

# This will:
# - Read your playwright-coverage.config.js
# - Create a new playwright.config.ts with the reporter
# - Preserve your existing settings
```

#### Manual Migration

1. **Convert your configuration**:

**Before (standalone):**
```javascript
// playwright-coverage.config.js
module.exports = {
  include: ['**/*.spec.ts'],
  exclude: ['node_modules/**'],
  coverageThreshold: 80,
  outputPath: './coverage-report',
  pageUrls: ['http://localhost:3000'],
  reportFormat: 'html'
};
```

**After (reporter):**
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import { PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['html'],
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, CoveragePresets.development({
      threshold: 80,
      outputPath: './coverage-report',
      pageUrls: ['http://localhost:3000']
    })]
  ],

  webServer: {
    command: 'npm start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

2. **Update your CI/CD pipeline**:

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Coverage Analysis
  run: npx playwright-coverage analyze --format istanbul
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Run Tests with Coverage
  run: npx playwright test

- name: Process Coverage Reports
  run: # Coverage is already generated during tests
```

#### Benefits of Migration

- **‚úÖ Native Integration**: Works seamlessly with Playwright's test runner
- **üöÄ Better Performance**: No duplicate browser launches
- **üìä Real-time Data**: Coverage based on actual test execution
- **üîÑ Automatic**: No separate commands needed
- **üì± Multi-browser**: Coverage across all configured browsers

#### Troubleshooting Migration

**Issue**: My coverage reports are different after migration
- **Solution**: The reporter uses real test execution data instead of static analysis, providing more accurate results

**Issue**: Missing coverage for some elements
- **Solution**: Enable `runtimeDiscovery: true` in your reporter configuration

**Issue**: Tests are running slower
- **Solution**: Disable `runtimeDiscovery` or `elementDiscovery` if not needed

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Static Analysis**: Scans your test files to extract all selectors used in Playwright test commands
2. **Element Discovery**: Launches a browser to discover all interactive elements on specified pages
3. **Coverage Calculation**: Matches discovered elements against test selectors to determine coverage
4. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive reports in multiple formats

## üìã Examples

### Real-World Usage Examples

#### 1. React Application with Login and Dashboard

**Test file (`tests/auth.spec.ts`):**
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Authentication Flow', () => {
  test('user can login and access dashboard', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/login');

    // Login form elements
    await page.fill('#email', 'user@example.com');
    await page.fill('#password', 'password123');
    await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

    // Dashboard elements
    await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Dashboard');
    await page.click('[data-testid="profile-menu"]');
    await page.click('text=Logout');
  });
});
```

**Coverage Result:**
```
üìä Coverage Summary:
   Total Elements: 15
   Covered Elements: 8
   Coverage: 53%

üìÑ Coverage by Type:
   Buttons: 3/5 (60%)
   Inputs: 2/2 (100%)
   Links: 3/8 (38%)

üí° Recommendations:
   ‚Ä¢ Add tests for navigation links in header
   ‚Ä¢ Test the settings button in dashboard
```

#### 2. E-commerce Application

**Test file (`tests/checkout.spec.ts`):**
```typescript
test('complete purchase flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/products/laptop');

  // Product page
  await page.click('button:has-text("Add to Cart")');
  await page.click('[data-testid="cart-icon"]');

  // Checkout process
  await page.click('button:has-text("Proceed to Checkout")');
  await page.fill('#shipping-address', '123 Main St');
  await page.fill('#payment-card', '4111111111111111');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Complete Purchase")');

  // Confirmation
  await expect(page.locator('text=Thank you for your order')).toBeVisible();
});
```

#### 3. Multi-Page Application Analysis

**Configuration for multiple pages:**
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { PlaywrightCoverageReporter } from 'playwright-coverage-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    [PlaywrightCoverageReporter, {
      outputPath: './coverage-report',
      format: 'all',
      threshold: 75,
      elementDiscovery: true,
      pageUrls: [
        'https://app.example.com',
        'https://app.example.com/login',
        'https://app.example.com/dashboard',
        'https://app.example.com/settings'
      ],
      runtimeDiscovery: true
    }]
  ]
});
```

### Different Selector Patterns Supported

The tool detects and matches various Playwright selector patterns:

```typescript
// All these selectors are detected and analyzed:
await page.click('#submit-button');           // ID selector
await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]');    // Test ID selector
await page.click('button:has-text("Login")'); // Text selector
await page.fill('input[name="username"]');    // Attribute selector
await page.click('role=button');               // Role selector
await page.getByLabel('Email').fill('...');     // Label selector
await page.getByPlaceholder('Password').fill('...'); // Placeholder selector
```

### Coverage Analysis Result

After running the coverage analysis, you'll get a detailed report showing:
- **Elements Covered**: Which interactive elements are tested
- **Missing Coverage**: Elements that need tests
- **Coverage by Type**: Breakdown by button, input, link, etc.
- **Specific Recommendations**: Actionable advice for improving coverage
- **File-level Insights**: Which test files cover which elements
